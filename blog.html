<p><em>This post is currently a work in progress. I&#8217;ll be working on this in the coming weeks and will be compiling my thoughts here. Eventually, I will edit this and use this as my case study</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Problem</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Real estate agencies potentially have over a thousand clients (landlords &amp; tenants) and potentially have tens of thousands of events to keep track of such as payments, lease renewals, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So, how do you communicate with all these people?</strong> <strong>And how do you keep track of everything?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>The Problem Quantified</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s quantify this by looking into two scenarios. A medium sized agency with 300 properties under management and a large agency with 1000 properties. We will assume each property has one landlord and one tenant. To work out the amount of payments per week, let&#8217;s guestimate and multiply the amount of tenants by 70%.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Example 1: Medium Sized Agency (300 Properties Under Management)</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>300 Properties = 300 Tenants + 300 Landlords = <strong>600 Clients</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>300 Tenants * 70% = <strong>210 Payments Per Week</strong><br>210 Payments PW * 52 Weeks = <strong>10,920 Payments Per Year</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Example 2: Large Sized Agency (1000 Properties Under Management) </strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>1000 Properties = 1000 Tenants + 1000 Landlords = <strong>1000 Clients</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>1000 Tenants * 70% = <strong>700 Payments Per Week</strong><br>700 Payments PW * 52 Weeks = <strong>36,400 Payments Per Year</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It isn&#8217;t feasible to send manually send tens of thousands of emails.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>A (Simplified) Look At The Tenant Payments Workflow</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"609\" src=\"https://blog.teeang.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Concept-map-Community-1-1024x609.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-69\" srcset=\"https://blog.teeang.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Concept-map-Community-1-1024x609.png 1024w, https://blog.teeang.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Concept-map-Community-1-300x178.png 300w, https://blog.teeang.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Concept-map-Community-1-768x456.png 768w, https://blog.teeang.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Concept-map-Community-1-1536x913.png 1536w, https://blog.teeang.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Concept-map-Community-1-1568x932.png 1568w, https://blog.teeang.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Concept-map-Community-1.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Tenants pays rent to agency. Agency processes payments and sends the receipts to the tenants.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What would happen the receipts were not sent to the tenant?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a customer experience standpoint, the tenant wouldn&#8217;t know where their rent is paid up to. And in order to find out, they would have to either email or call the agency. <em>That&#8217;s an extra step for the tenants</em>. If it isn&#8217;t convenient, people won&#8217;t bother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the agent&#8217;s perspective, there&#8217;s added overhead due to the extra phone calls and emails. In addition, managing rental arrears* becomes a bigger pain point. This is something you would want to nip in the bud straight away. <em>Trust me, evicting a tenant takes a lot of time.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>*  Automated Payments Processing is another potential feature. It isn&#8217;t part of the minimum viable product, so it will be out of scope for now.<br>** Arrears refers to the rent and/or utililies usage owed to the agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Solution</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We automate your workflows, so that you can focus on your business.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>pmcloud needs to cover all the aspects of property management well and use thoughtful automation to improve workflows. We can use something like MailChimp or Twilio/SendGrid to batch SMS or email our tenants. As for things such as lease renewals, insurance renewals &amp; organising routine inspections, pmcloud needs to provide interactive reports that would allow the property manager to take action.</p>  </div>
